Develop a list of 15-20 interview questions for a meeting with the CFO of a tech company that will soon be selling a business unit. 
Remember, your questions should be focused on these areas: How do you ascertain their goals for the divestiture? How do you probe around what support that business unit received from the broader company?

Follow the steps below to complete this task: 

Start by determining what topics you may need to understand. Key topics could include financial performance, integration/entanglement with the rest of the company (systems, processes, people, etc.), motivation for divestiture, etc.
 
Once you have determined key topics, write high-priority questions for each.
Tip: consider why you are asking each question. What potential actions or insights could those questions drive?
 
Once you have written your questions, consider what order would be the most impactful. Rearrange your questions for maximum impact.
