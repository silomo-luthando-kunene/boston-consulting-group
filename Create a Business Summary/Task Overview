I began by determining which categories of information which would be most beneficial to the diligence and target management teams respectively. This is information relating to the company and the industry it competes in etc. From the information I received I thereafter created an outline based on the various categories I had intially looked at.
I then proceeded to write out my outline of [COMPANY NAME]. This was done by looking at various helpful resources about {COMPANY NAME} such as their company financial statements and investory relations material.
Finally I organised and communicated my findings in a professional manner.
