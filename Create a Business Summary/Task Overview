# Task Overview 

1. Consider the categories of information you find most critical to the company, industry, etc., and create an outline of your document based on those categories. (See the template below for reference, and feel free to use/modify it for your submission.)

2. Start filling in your outline for a company of your choice. Company financial statements and investor materials are a great place to start (for listed companies, this information can be easy to find.)
Note: Companies have some flexibility in what they report, so you may not find all the data you deem important (e.g., you may not find data on the revenues per product). When this happens, look at other sources or pivot your categories as needed.)

3. When you finish filling in your information, double-check the document to make sure the information is organized and communicated clearly. 

4. Submit your completed document below (as Word file).
