In this task I develop an interview question list for the CFO of a tech company that will be selling its business unit and with the interview questions I try to investigate the goals and ambitions of this tech company with regards to their decision to disinvest. 
This tech company has outsourced services from PWC to assist with its divestiture and as a result I have been tasked by the PWC to assist by coming up with interview questions that an employee from PWC will use on the CFO in a meeting.

I highlight the following topics:
Financial Performance.
Integration/Entanglement with the rest of the company (system, processes, people etc.)
Motivation for the divestiture.
