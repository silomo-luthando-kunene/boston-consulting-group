complete a quick task from a partner in the aviation practice. They are working with a national airline that is considering acquiring a smaller regional player to increase the number of routes they can service daily.

You’ve got some sparse notes and high-level data from the client. You should make a quick model based on the notes and data to give a directional sense of synergy potential.

Be sure to view the Resources for supervisor notes and client data before you begin. When you finish, send the file in an email with a clear and concise summary of the findings. Include a recommendation for the next steps at the end of your note.
