I had to complete a quick task from a partner in aviation practice. They were working with a national airline that is considering acquiring a smaller regional player to increase the number of routes they can service daily.
Along with offering more routes to customers, the partner expected this deal to create opportunities for some exciting revenue and cost synergies.

I was given some sparse notes and high-level data from the client which I used to make a quick model to give a directional sense of synergy potential.
Upon completing my model on an excel sheet I then was tasked with writing an email with a clear and concise summary of the findings which included a recommendation for the next steps.
