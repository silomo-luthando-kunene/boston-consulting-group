I had to choose a recent merger or acquisition and read two or three articles about the transaction.
Based on my research and creative thinking, I was tasked with developing a list of four or five synergies expected from the transaction.
I then structured the synergies I found into three slides in an organised manner.
Lastly I created the “skeleton” of your presentation by placing titles and subtitles across the three slides.
This presentation was meant to be tailored for university students so they could grasp a few real world examples of synergies in terms of business, specifically within the context of a merger or acquisition.
