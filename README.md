 # Project: Anglo American et al.
Management Consulting

### Project Overview
* Task 1: PWC wants to determine if they should intiate the investigating and auditing of Anglo American and its financials in order to assess whether they should enter into a proposed transaction with PWC. As a member of the consulting team we were tasked with compiling a business summary of Anglo American which would then be used by the diligence team (also known as the auditing team) to determine if due diligence should be undertaken by PWC.

* Task 2: A client has consulted PWC to determine whether selling a business unit is a viable business solution to the current problem they face. My assigned task was to come up with investigative questions for the CFO of the company to assist a member of our team who will be interviewing and engaging the CFO on the decision to divest. The following topics are investigated in the interview questions:
  *   Financial
  *   Legislature, Government Policy and Politics
  *   Synergy/Differences with Company Strategy
  *   Company Values, Mission/Strategy and Ethos/Culture
  *   Company Leadership/Executive
    
* Task 3: The goal of this task was just to learn how to briefly put together a presentation of findings, in this instance for university students. I was tasked with identifying a merger or acquisition that took place and presenting the synergies of the two companies that have either merger or been acquired to showcase why the merger or acquisition would be successful.
 
* Task 4:
